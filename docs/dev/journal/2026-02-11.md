# Dev Journal Entry 08

### Brief work description

I implemented most of the goals I set out to do in the last milestone. The video pipeline is now fully 
parameter-driven. This is a huge step, now automation can control the plugin and it works exactly as we wanted it to.
Persistence now works and the plugin saves the video even on project reopen. 

Messaging turned out to be a bad option for handling continuous modulation data, everything stays based on parameter 
interaction for now.

With the addition of saving and automation support, I was actually able to make the plugin be exportable when the 
*export in real-time* option is selected. Now the question remains if we should support offline export too or just 
require the user to use this export setting. There are definitely positives/negatives for both. 

### Future plans

- Decide whether the modulation vector is needed
- Implement fun feature extractors
- Brightness for EQ (hi vs. low)
