# Dev Journal Entry 09

### Brief work description

I started writing about the architecture of the project which prompted me to gather better arguments on why the 
pipeline controller is on the side of the EditController. Because this breaks the VST rules a bit. 

But I did try to experiment with migrating it to the AudioProcessor side and in that setup, steady video playback to 
the GUI is 
just not possible in my opinion. The video frames need to somehow get to the controller but: parameters are out of 
question, messages are not consistent, and data exchange only works for transfer in the process() method. This would 
result in the video not playing when the timeline isn't moving.

### Future plans

- Modulation vector as a one-time push
