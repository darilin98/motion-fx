# Dev Journal Entry 02

### Brief work description

I created a lot of new classes and the design is slowly but surely coming together.

A tricky part was figuring out how I want to distribute responsibilities between the playback controller/media 
loader/decoder. What I wanted to avoid is merging the decoder and loader to only one class because I believe they 
have slightly different concerns.

Now I also have a very primitive bitmap rendering view but it is nice, we shall see if it can handle fast refreshing 
or if the algorithm will need to be changed a bit (there should be plenty of room for that).

### Future plans

- Implement ffmpeg loader
- Connect pipeline to audio processing

A problem I need to figure out is the frame queue - how will the 2 consumers interact with it. My current rough idea 
is that the feature extract process will not remove the items from queue only get a snapshot of the earliest frame. 
The render thread is expected to iterate faster and consume them.
