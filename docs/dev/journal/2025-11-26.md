# Dev Journal Entry 03

### Brief work description

I started by implementing scaling for the frames which the view consumes. I decided not to break encapsulation and 
decode in native resolution. Then only the view knows the size of its rect and scales the input to its own desires.

So far im just using a primitive nearest neighbor scaling algorithm which adds some aliasing, but it should not 
matter that much. It seems that the system can handle 25 fps well despite the fact that it needs to scale every 
input frame.

Then I moved on to working on the ffmpeg video decoder. This works pretty well and is not a source of many problems.

It looks like the frame queue is the most critical point of this pipeline (as expected). Sometimes the producer 
(decoder) runs faster, other times slower and this needs to be handled.

### Future plans

- `[Immediate]` Fix video playback termination/state control - terminate all work properly 
- Implement the second consumer - feature extract from the rgba frame data

### Estimated time spent

| **Project Task** | **Time spent** |
|:----------------:|:--------------:|
|  Image scaling   |    2 hours     |
|  Video decoder   |    4 hours     |
| Video frame view |    6 hours     |
