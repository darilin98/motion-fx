# Dev Journal Entry 04

### Brief work description

I fixed the crashing video playback behavior. A neat solution to the playback stopping problem is that I made a 
callback that the view initiates when it sees an empty frame, the controller then decides whether it should 
terminate it or the empty frame was just a result of the consumer running ahead.

A major thing I realized is that I need to move the decoder calls away from the VSTGUI task API. The decoding and 
feature extract should work even if the views are detached. This also means that I will need to migrate the playback 
controller's ownership to the main plugin controller.

### Future plans

- Start work on elementary feature extraction
