# Dev Journal Entry 05

### Brief work description

I introduced the `Ticker` to the pipeline: 

- It exists without being bound to VSTGUI view
- It can register all IFrameReceivers to which it sends frames on callback.
- PlaybackController runs and stops it.

All IFrameReceivers are now "stupid" and only act upon a received frame

I thought about and tackled some major architecture questions.

#### `PlaybackConroller` ownership options:

A) Processor owns the pipeline

    + Guaranteed thread lifetime
    + Params could stay local and not be defined by VST standards
    - Very troublesome passing of references to the controller
    - Controller needs to know about the pipeline -> it initiates it
	Possible solutions include: IConnectionPoint, IPlaybackService

B) EditController owns the pipeline

    + Much easier state management
    - Communication through VST params
    + VST params can be hidden to automation and made read-only
    ? UI Thread lifetime is very vague (and the naming too), it should be alive to call changes to params but the 
      docs aren't explicit about it

--- 

Some audio modulation now finally works. Gain is not enough for a good demonstration, now it needs a very crazy 
video in order to have some effect.

### Future plans

- Migrate the PlaybackController's ownership to EditController
- Support running pipeline with view closed
- More feature extraction
