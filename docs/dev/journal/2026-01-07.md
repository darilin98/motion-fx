# Dev Journal Entry 06

### Brief work description

I managed to pass the ownership of the video pipeline to the EditController. After some tweaking and proper 
thread safety, closing the view and opening it works perfectly. It is completely independent and just detaches while 
the effect can still be heard. 

This means the plugin is now in a very good state to start experimenting with various ways of getting effects out of 
video.

I really like how the architecture turned out - that we have abstract receivers that just attach and detach from the 
pipeline without affecting it.

### Future plans

- Add automatable playback controls
- Feature extraction experiments

### Estimated time spent

|     **Project Task**      | **Time spent** |
