# Dev Journal Entry 01

This marks the beginning of this VST plugin project. I pick up where we left off in the development of Polynomial 
Equalizer. 

---

The current vision for the project:

- User uploads a media file and with use of some *magic* the base audio track will get modulated in relation with 
  the content.
- Features from the media get mapped to effect parameters
- Possibility of 3D GUI for the user to select preferences for audio effects
- Should be able to set up for different instruments 

#### Brief work description

I copied the minimal skeleton from my previous plugin planned out some file structure organization. Overall I'm 
feeling like this project is much cleaner and I want to keep to good practices from the very start.

My first challenge was to run a file opening pop-up and properly handle the file path so that it can be further 
processed by some component. This I achieved using a subcontroller approach which turned out pretty clean.

### Estimated time spent

I want to try and measure my time spent on this project a bit better than on the preceding one, in order for the 
hour counts to more accurately represent reality.

|   **Project Task**    | **Time spent** |
|:---------------------:|:--------------:|
| Coding file selection |    6 hours     |
|   Repo organization   |    2 hours     |
| Project architecture  |    3 hours     |
|   General research    |    2 hours     |
